### 1. What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?
- *var*: Function-scoped or globally-scoped. It can be re-declared and updated.
- *let*: Block-scoped. It can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.
- *const*: Block-scoped. It cannot be updated or re-declared. It is used for constants.

### 2. How do you create a new React component?
You can create a new React component by defining a function or a class:
// Functional Component
function MyComponent() {
    return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}

// Class Component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
    }
}


### 3. What is the purpose of the render() method in a React component?
The render() method returns the JSX that describes what should be displayed on the screen. It is called every time the component's state or props change.

### 4. How do you handle state changes in a React component?
State changes can be handled using this.setState() in class components or the useState() hook in functional components.
// Class Component
this.setState({ key: value });

// Functional Component
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
setState(newValue);


### 5. What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled component in React?
- *Controlled Component*: The component's state is managed by React. The input value is set via props.
- *Uncontrolled Component*: The component maintains its own internal state. You can access the value using refs.

### 6. How do you pass props to a React component?
Props can be passed to a component as attributes when it is instantiated:
<MyComponent propName="value" />


### 7. What is the purpose of the key prop in a React component?
The key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, thus optimizing rendering performance in lists.

### 8. How do you handle events in a React component?
Events can be handled by defining an event handler function and passing it as a prop:
<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>


### 9. What is the difference between a functional component and a class component in React?
- *Functional Component*: A simpler way to write components using functions. They can use hooks for state and lifecycle methods.
- *Class Component*: More complex, uses ES6 class syntax, and has access to lifecycle methods directly.

### 10. How do you use React Hooks?
Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class:
import { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
};


### 11. What is the purpose of the useEffect() hook in React?
The useEffect() hook lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching or subscribing to events. It runs after every render by default.

### 12. How do you fetch data from an API in a React component?
You can fetch data using useEffect() along with fetch() or any other HTTP library like Axios:
useEffect(() => {
    fetch('api/url')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => setData(data));
}, []);


### 13. What is the purpose of the useContext() hook in React?
The useContext() hook allows you to access context values without wrapping components in a Consumer component, making it easier to share values between components.

### 14. How do you use React Router for client-side routing?
You can use react-router-dom to define routes:
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<Router>
    <Route path="/about" component={About} />
</Router>


### 15. Difference between useState() and useReducer() in React?
- *useState()*: A simpler hook for managing state with a single value.
- *useReducer()*: A more complex hook that allows managing state with multiple values or when the next state depends on the previous one, using a reducer function.

### 16. How do you optimize the performance of a React application?
You can optimize performance by:
- Using React.memo() for functional components.
- Implementing shouldComponentUpdate() in class components.
- Code splitting with dynamic imports.
- Using lazy loading for images and components.

### 17. What is the purpose of the shouldComponentUpdate() method in a React component?
The shouldComponentUpdate() method allows you to optimize rendering by determining whether a component should re-render based on changes in props or state.

### 18. How do you use React DevTools for debugging?
React DevTools is a browser extension that lets you inspect the React component hierarchy, view props and state, and track performance issues.

### 19. What is the difference between a Higher-Order Component (HOC) and a Render Props pattern in React?
- *Higher-Order Component (HOC)*: A function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior.
- *Render Props*: A technique where a component receives a function as a prop that returns JSX, allowing for dynamic rendering.

### 20. How do you use React with TypeScript?
To use React with TypeScript, install TypeScript and type definitions for React:
npm install typescript @types/react @types/react-dom

Then create components with type annotations:
const MyComponent: React.FC<PropsType> = ({ propName }) => {
    return <div>{propName}</div>;
};
